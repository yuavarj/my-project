<h2>Swaraj Dweep, earlier known as Havelock Island,[3] is one of the largest islands in Ritchie's Archipelago, to the east of Great Andaman within the Andaman Islands.

    Havelock Island was previously named after a British general, Sir Henry Havelock, who served in India.[5]
    
    In December 2018, it was renamed, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as Swaraj Island as a tribute to Subhas Chandra Bose. Bose had hoisted the Indian flag at Port Blair on 30 December 1943 and proclaimed the Andaman and Nicobar Islands as liberated from British rule. He had subsequently named Neil Island as Shaheed Dweep and Ross Island was renamed as Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Dweep as well.[6]
